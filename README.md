</h1>
<h3 align="center">
I am a Beverly, Massachusetts-based Software Engineer who enjoys running, music, golfing, and Ultimate (frisbee). A naturally creative and curious person, I have always been interested in finding ways to help and impact others in a positive way. It is because of this that I began my career as an educator, which allowed me to make a difference on a daily basis. As I looked for opportunities to make bigger impacts, I became a manager who first focused on improving a residential facility for adults with severe special needs at Bridgewell Inc. and then helped manage the team and reshape the customer's experience of a multi-million dollar financial practice for Northwestern Mutual. Now, as a Software Engineer, I am excited for the endless opportunities to make lasting positive impacts on many people's lives for as long as technology exists.

  <ins>JEOPARDY</ins>
</h2>
<h3 align="center">
My very first project - made using jQuery, CSS3 & HTML5 - completed in 1-week's time for General Assembly. This is an interactive JEOPARDY application game that users can clone and play on their devices locally. The game utilizes a scoring system and timers so that the user has a limited amount of time to complete as many questions as they can.

  <ins>North Shore Beer Explorer</ins>
</h2>
<h3 align="center">
My second project - made using JavaScript, CSS3 & HTML5, utilizing MongoDB, Mongoose, ejs, express.js & methodOverride - completed in 1-week's time for General Assembly. This is an interactive application that is deployed on Heroku for anyone to benefit from. Originally intended for people visiting the 'North Shore' of Massachusetts (just North of Boston), this application has a list of local breweries and their corresponding towns/cities. When a brewery logo is clicked, the user is taken to a more detailed page specific to the selected brewery. This includes a few of the author's favorite beverages at the location, the hours, and the average untappd rating. The user is also able to edit & update each brewery as they see fit, add a new brewery, or delete them altogether.

  <ins>WAQ Vinyl</ins>
</h2>
<h3 align="center">
My third project (and first group-project) - made using React, RESTful Routes, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, utilizing MongoDB, Mongoose, node.js, express.js, bcrypt, cors, dotenv, npm, bootstrap, Heroku, MongoDB Atlas, and the Discogs API - completed in 1-week's time for General Assembly. This is an application that allows the user to search for albums, add them to a list of owned records in their personal collection, and add to their wishlist. We use a simple crud application that searches the discog API based on the artist and/or album. The search feature returns up to 50 results per search.

  <ins>BehaviorBuddy</ins>
</h2>
<h3 align="center">
My fourth project - made using React Native, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, utilizing MongoDB, Mongoose, node.js, express.js, cors, dotenv, npm, bootstrap, Heroku, MongoDB Atlas - completed in 2-week's time for my final project at General Assembly. This is a mobile application that I am extremely passionate about. Originally intended for parents & teachers of children with special needs, this application contains a customized (and expanding) database of helpful information. Based mostly around Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), the user can search a keyword/keywords that they are curious about (or just scroll through the database to learn about different things). Results populate and provide a definition, methods/strategies, and resources.
